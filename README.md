## **What is Full Stack Development?**

### **Frontend**
- **Definition**: Everything you see and interact with on a website comes under the Frontend.
- **Technologies Used**: 
  - **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create layouts and interactive features.
  - **React**: Simplifies building complex frontend applications and connects seamlessly with the backend.
- **Example**:
  - On Amazon, features like the search bar, product display, and "Add to Cart" button are part of the frontend.

### **Backend**
- **Definition**: The logic and operations happening behind the scenes to make the frontend work.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - **Python** for efficient logic and operations.
  - **Django** for connecting the frontend with the database and handling backend workflows.
- **Example**:
  - When you search for a product on Amazon, the backend processes the query, retrieves relevant data from the database, and sends it to the frontend.

### **Database (DB)**
- **Definition**: Stores all essential data such as user credentials, product information, and transaction details.
- **Example**:
  - When you search for a product on Amazon, the database fetches product details like name, price, and availability.
